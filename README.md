# Useful Codes to Generate Some Data

## 1. Data Generator for T-Test

`t-test-data-generator` :  Generates a dataset in the form of a dictonary with an experiment and control group given the mean, standard deviation and sample size. It then generates an experiment and control group which consists of participants that are one or two standard deviation away from each other.

## 2. Exam List Creator
`exam_list_creator`: Takes in an excel sheet with name-surname and student numbers and returns randomized, alphabetically ordered lists given the number of students in the classrooms. Can make up to 3 lists given a single list.
